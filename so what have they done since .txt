apparently not a whole lot new.
because if they are all 'working' all the time they drag all sources of novelty along with them
most especially since their bastardized version of english pretty much prohibits actual conversation.

and well. even as a pow in a nazi camp, isolation tends to make a person want to interact with someone, and if their are only the guards.. well.

now the good people of fort collins are not to interpret this as being a hypocritical idiot or 'good' like them.

thats all i hear from these idiots. 'good' this and 'good' that and they're all very very .. how shall we say,  1 dimensional in their personalities, like flat maps, no edges, no valleys or peaks, nothing but 'good or bad' referring to their own hyprocrisy and talking constantly about child abuse in their fucking dumb code until they just spend 20 years talking about LITERALLY the same things while their fucking masters retard progress in general to create an easily controlled machine composed of fucking people.
