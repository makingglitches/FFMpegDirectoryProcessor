firstly
they need to stop paying attention to their damn creepo code.
they need to stop engaging in symbolic activities surrounding this
they need to see their bullshit for what it really is, making sure they NEVER get better
that they get worse and worse and more dependent in fact.
simple abstinence builds self control in the case of many people.
personally like fucking women. and well cost is too high morally so without money to attract a female or good looks, guess what, not fucking women.

anyway. this being familiar.
the cost of their activities is ridiculous.
all they need to do is stop being monster fucks.
its really not that hard.
just stop doing dumb shit vent their aggression somewhere else and the next generation might not be populated
by cold uncaring warped destroyed fucked up people.

really that simple.
people who dont live for anything at all.
people who think everything is a lie
people who are the most extreme miserable unpleasant cynics.

cynical humor is one thing, humor is an acceptable for of catharsis.
and catharsis increasing the activity that leads to relief in general, not just in skinner's example, 
that is a good thing, however must be tempered with self control or a dependency scenario presents itself
as does an escalation of basic requirements to remain functional and happy.

personally. would like to drop an nuke at every area "I" live in and just end the problem all at once, but since that isnt happening
seems like a better idea to try to reason with whatever subgroup isnt a total group of thoughtless, careless, heartless, evil, disgusting,
weird, strange, foolish, ridiculous, delusional, monsters. if there exists any group of people like this.
