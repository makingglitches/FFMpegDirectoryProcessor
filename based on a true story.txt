we're going to wear out their ability to compensate remotely :P eventually they will not have some stupid numerical sequence preassigned, in fact may just finish that better random number generator and send random packets of information to fucking github and display sequences. until the repetitive hand motions become consistent and then ill have a female slap her titties on my keyboard and pay her 20 bucks to do and another 500 to fuck her in the ass to see how that changes the environmental fucking modifiers that seed said random number generator.

put them to their intended purpose. fucking bastards. god they are sad when they're young but they're monsters when they're older and should be treated as such simply because their are so fucking many of them.

this was originally making fun of people we know were reading this, just in case they wonder, since the ordinar uses for things combined with the lack of precision of certain sampling devices, conditioned responses to LITERALLY the same series of cascading events, lack of novelty and weather, as well as lighting conditions being relatively repetitive to almost complete precision can be covered up anyway from a presampled stack at points and the less precision applied or the more rounding the more likely those numbers are the same unless of course they just pull from a stack of them which have already been shoved in storage somewhere to confuse and confound individuals who are doing things like GENERATING FUCKING RANDOM NUMBERS.

god feels like i'm being stabbed in the brain.

baby raping fucks like anna tyson of fruitville pk in lancaster pa :P

ps.
autumn, we enjoyed the fucking head immensely years ago, twisted fucking bitch :P should have fucked de ass. :P de pussy is probably ridden with nasties but looks nice, could have triple wrapped bahahahahhaha
