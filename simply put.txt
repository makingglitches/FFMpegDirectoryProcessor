this is not out of love of them.
they get off on making life meaningless which is why they themselves are meaningless.
so cant say this is out of desire to make my own life meaningful.
but the idea of horror acting on their miswired brain, not in the form of fiction
fiction is not real.
fiction excites because their is a detachment from the actual subject matter or an ability for us to empathize 
thats why game of thrones sucked ass.
everyone fucking died and they made everyone that was inherently evil less black and white.

truth is, evil vicious people, really are just evil and vicious especially when they're raised to be evil and vicious and accept this role.
because survival tendencies have been exploited to make them evil and vicious and sadistic, they're not that complicated once the outcome is reached.

and if this note seems familiar that is because this note IS familiar.
